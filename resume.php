      <p>After joining a large-scale visitor registration project following its first release, quickly learned the application, started to improve and document existing code. Essentially doubled the application’s capabilities by creating a module to register contractors with expired yearly credentials. This led to becoming the lead developer within a year. Was able to direct the team to manage existing code, start another large code improvement effort, and add another large component that manages all aspects of large scale meetings.</p>
      <p>Responsible for the creation of multiple applications at NRL. Supported the entire development process by gathering requirements, researching user needs, creating design comps, validating them with the client,  developing the application, testing, and releasing to production. Used MVC techniques during development while focusing on data integrity, and trying to ensure a positive user experience. Examples of these applications are: a facility meeting scheduler that allows for online reservations, and management approval options; a publication management system that stores publications to for website display; and a file repository which collect data from subjects via automatic and manual file uploads.</p>
      <p>Redesigned templates used for basic websites scientists and researchers use to publicize and offer their publications for sale. These templates were created to support both Drupal and an older, homegrown content management system. The new templates were designed to ensure section 508 compliance, instituted simple, clean page design, and best practice web standards-compliance.</p>
