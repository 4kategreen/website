<h3>Goal Pace and Workout Paces</h3>
<p>Here are the workout documents. In order to determine paces, go to the <a href="http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/calculator">McMillan Running Calculator</a> and enter the time for your most recent race. For many of you, this will be the mile time trial on 5/15, but any recent race will do. If you don't have one, try to estimate.</p>

<h3>Race Information</h3>
<p>The target race is the Women's Distance Festival/Men Run after the Women 5K in Annapolis on July 14. The registration link will be posted here and I'll let you know when I see it.</p>
